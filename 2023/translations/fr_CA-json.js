You can award someone by clicking on \\"Give Award\\" below their post or comment. This distinguishes it with an Award for all to see, and some even grant the honoree special bonus benefits.","2ysK1l":"What are these new Award types?","Mvg07":"There are now several ways to Give Awards. A Silver Award requires 100 coins, which simply marks a post or comment with a Silver Award icon. A classic Gold Award requires 500 coins and gives the recipient a week of Reddit Premium membership and 100 coins. Finally, the ultra rare Platinum Award costs 1800 coins, and gives the recipient with one month of Reddit Premium membership, which includes 700 coins for that month.","4a4pGf":"I bought coins, how can I tell how many I have?","2VWZ2s":"If you buy coins you will always have a balance associated with your Reddit account.

Stay tuned!","qTu5W":"What happened to Creddits? Do those still exist?","3bz9Wy":"Yes, Creddits are simply called \\"coins\\" now, and we\'ve converted any existing balance at a generous exchange rate of one Creddit to 2000 coins. That\'s double their original monetary value as a thank you for supporting us early. Use them to award exceptional posts and comments you come across. Thanks again for your contribution to the Reddit community.","26YDse":"I thought Gold was the name of Reddit\'s subscription membership?","aFpGc":"You\'re correct, it used to also be the name of the subscription membership. However, many people confused the subscription \\"Reddit Gold\\" membership with a virtual good or coin. To make things easier to understand, we\'ve renamed the membership to \\"Reddit Premium\\", while our virtual good is called \\"coins\\".","3sxu4T":"Reconnaissance des commentaires","4FXS1Z":"D√©marquez-vous dans les commentaires avec un anneau autour de votre avatar","k1D64":"Prix Powerups","1FdKZ7":"Des prix exclusifs √† utiliser dans votre communaut√©","15Pxs":"Accomplissements","lhUOn":"Reconna√Ætre les contributions et les comp√©tences des membres","GDxZa":"SD video","2KPR6O":"Vid√©o HD","1rvNwn":"T√©l√©versez et visionnez en plus haute r√©solution","1wXiEa":"R√©ponses GIF","2qt00u":"√âmojis personnalis√©s","4cQwCT":"Utilisez des √©mojis con√ßus sp√©cialement pour cette communaut√©","1P6ot7":"T√©l√©charger des images","miGwE":"Statut de h√©ros","2bnnTY":"Soyez sur la liste des h√©ros et acc√©dez instantan√©ment √† tous les avantages","3ksSuD":"Plus √† venir‚Ä¶","2bar0C":{"*":"{number of months} months {number of coins} Coins","_1":"1 month {number of coins} Coins"},"19EtMU":"Reddit - Buy Premium","48rKNT":"Reddit - Buy Coins","1lx9I1":"Reddit - Coins Conversion","2kKP5R":"Bot Ban","2NKibN":"Perma Ban","4tkpUP":"Bannir","3yQJ5":"Avertissement d\'abus","4sYfYD":"Avertissement de contenu ind√©sirable","3CoM4o":"Surveillance de contenu ind√©sirable","31uTvb":"Bon¬∑ne contributeur¬∑rice","1iapJ2":"Utile","2DbFlZ":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t downvoted anything yet","Bf1JR":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t hidden anything yet","3WyBqC":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t recently viewed anything yet","6odfL":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t saved anything yet","4voq8V":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t upvoted anything yet","3NhMZq":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t received any awards yet","2UdWhD":"hmm... looks like you haven\'t given any awards yet","3jbs05":"Publication","1b6xGG":"commentaire","2Wxjcu":"post and comment","2nFG0L":"cr√©er","1LrMyG":"draft","43LL8D":"Anyone can view this community, but only approved users can {restrictionType}","2nTKRD":"Remerciements","3Fr8Lf":"I have read the {=Reddit Content Policy} and the {=Suspensions help article} .","1zrL2W":"Politique de contenu de Reddit","1M9zrX":"Suspensions help article","3lQu7u":"Appeal received","2VTm7m":"Thanks for submitting your request.
